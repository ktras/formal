  ! PURPOSE: Definition of procedure to report the number of boundary-adjacent locations at which the Laplacian has reduced-order accuracy.
  ! KEYWORDS: Laplacian, boundary, order of accuracy
  ! CONTEXT: Use this function to determine the region of slightly slower convergence for mimetic Laplacian approximations.
