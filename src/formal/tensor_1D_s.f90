  ! PURPOSE: Definition of procedure to construct a new tensor_1D_t object by assigning each argument to a corresponding
  !          corresponding component of the new object.
  ! KEYWORDS: 1D tensor constructor
  ! CONTEXT: Constructors for child types assign this function's result to to the child object's parent component.

  ! PURPOSE: Definition of procedure to provide a uniform cell width along the x-coordinate spatial direction.
  ! KEYWORDS: abcissa, mesh spacing
  ! CONTEXT: Use this function to produce cell widths for uniform 1D meshes.

  module procedure dx
    dx = (self%x_max_ - self%x_min_)/self%cells_
  end procedure
